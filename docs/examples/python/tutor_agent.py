# ðŸŽ“ Personalized Learning Tutor

A demonstration of using Strands Agents' memory capabilities to create an AI tutor
that adapts to individual learning styles and tracks educational progress.

## What This Example Shows

This example demonstrates:
- Creating an AI tutor with adaptive learning capabilities
- Tracking student progress and learning patterns
- Providing personalized explanations and examples
- Identifying knowledge gaps and learning preferences
- Maintaining learning context across sessions

## Usage Examples

Basic usage:
```
python tutor_agent.py
```

Import in your code:
```python
from examples.tutor_agent import tutor_agent

# Start a learning session
response = tutor_agent("I'm having trouble understanding recursion in Python")
print(response["message"]["content"][0]["text"])

# Continue learning
response = tutor_agent("Can you give me a simpler example?")
print(response["message"]["content"][0]["text"])
```

## Learning Features

1. **Adaptive Learning**:
   - Adjusts explanations based on student's level
   - Provides relevant examples
   - Identifies learning gaps

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Monitors understanding of concepts
   - Tracks completed exercises
   - Records learning preferences

3. **Personalized Support**:
   - Customized explanations
   - Targeted practice problems
   - Learning style adaptation
