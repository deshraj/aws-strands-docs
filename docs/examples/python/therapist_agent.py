# ðŸ§  AI Therapist Assistant

A demonstration of using Strands Agents' memory capabilities to create an AI therapy assistant
that maintains context and provides supportive responses while following ethical guidelines.

## What This Example Shows

This example demonstrates:
- Creating an AI therapy assistant with memory capabilities
- Maintaining therapeutic context across sessions
- Following ethical guidelines for AI therapy
- Providing supportive responses while respecting boundaries
- Tracking progress and patterns over time

## Usage Examples

Basic usage:
```
python therapist_agent.py
```

Import in your code:
```python
from examples.therapist_agent import therapist_agent

# Start a therapy session
response = therapist_agent("I've been feeling anxious about my upcoming presentation")
print(response["message"]["content"][0]["text"])

# Continue a previous conversation
response = therapist_agent("I tried the breathing exercise you suggested")
print(response["message"]["content"][0]["text"])
```

## Important Notes

This is a demonstration of AI capabilities and should not be used as a replacement for professional therapy.
Always seek professional help for serious mental health concerns.
