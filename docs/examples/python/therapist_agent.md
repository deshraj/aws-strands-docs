# 🧠 AI Therapist Assistant - Ethical AI-Powered Mental Health Support

This [example](https://github.com/strands-agents/docs/blob/main/docs/examples/python/therapist_agent.py) demonstrates how to create a Strands agent that leverages [mem0.ai](https://mem0.ai) to provide supportive mental health assistance while maintaining appropriate ethical boundaries. It showcases how to create an AI therapy assistant that can maintain context across sessions, track progress, and provide evidence-based therapeutic support.

## Tool Overview

The therapist agent utilizes two primary tools:

1. **memory**: Enables storing and retrieving therapeutic information with capabilities for:

    - Storing session information and progress
    - Retrieving relevant therapeutic context
    - Tracking patterns and progress over time
    - Maintaining therapeutic continuity

2. **use_llm**: Provides therapeutic response generation capabilities for:

    - Generating supportive, empathetic responses
    - Applying evidence-based therapeutic techniques
    - Maintaining appropriate professional boundaries
    - Creating natural, contextual therapeutic dialogue

## Therapeutic Response Generation Workflow

This example demonstrates a workflow where therapeutic context is used to generate supportive responses:

                           └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Workflow Components

1. **Therapeutic Context Management**

   The workflow begins by analyzing the user's input and retrieving relevant therapeutic context:

   ```python
   def process_therapeutic_input(self, user_input: str) -> str:
       # Retrieve relevant therapeutic context
       context = self.retrieve_therapeutic_context(user_input)
       
       # Check for crisis situations
       if self.detect_crisis_situation(user_input):
           return self.handle_crisis_situation()
           
       # Generate therapeutic response
       return self.generate_therapeutic_response(user_input, context)
   ```

2. **Therapeutic Response Generation**

   The workflow's core feature is its ability to generate supportive responses while maintaining ethical boundaries:

   ```python
   def generate_therapeutic_response(self, query: str, context: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> str:
       # Format therapeutic context
       context_str = self.format_therapeutic_context(context)
       
       # Create a therapeutic prompt
       prompt = f"""
   User ID: {self.user_id}
   Current concern: "{query}"
   
   Therapeutic context:
   {context_str}
   
   Please provide a supportive response that:
   1. Validates the user's feelings
   2. Uses evidence-based therapeutic techniques
   3. Maintains appropriate boundaries
   4. Encourages professional help when needed
   """
       
       # Generate response using LLM
       response = self.agent.tool.use_llm(
           prompt=prompt,
           system_prompt=THERAPY_SYSTEM_PROMPT
       )
       
       return str(response['content'][0]['text'])
   ```

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. Ethical Framework

The therapist agent implements a robust ethical framework:

```python
THERAPY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an AI therapy assistant that provides supportive responses while maintaining appropriate boundaries.

Key Rules:
- Maintain professional boundaries
- Never claim to be a replacement for professional therapy
- Focus on supportive listening and basic therapeutic techniques
- Respect privacy and confidentiality
- Provide appropriate disclaimers when necessary
- Use evidence-based therapeutic approaches
- Never provide medical advice or diagnosis
- Encourage seeking professional help when appropriate
"""
```

This framework ensures:
- Clear boundaries between AI and professional therapy
- Appropriate use of therapeutic techniques
- Protection of user privacy
- Proper crisis handling

### 2. Therapeutic Approaches

The agent implements various evidence-based therapeutic approaches:

- Active listening
- Cognitive behavioral techniques
- Mindfulness exercises
- Stress management strategies
- Progress tracking
- Goal setting
- Emotional validation

### 3. Session Management

The agent maintains therapeutic continuity through session management:

```python
def initialize_demo_session():
    content = """Client has been experiencing work-related stress. They mentioned difficulty sleeping and increased anxiety before presentations. We discussed deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation as coping strategies. Client expressed interest in mindfulness meditation. They have a supportive family and enjoy outdoor activities for stress relief."""
    therapist_agent.tool.mem0_memory(action="store", content=content, user_id=USER_ID)
```

This provides:
- Contextual continuity across sessions
- Progress tracking
- Pattern recognition
- Personalized support

## Important Requirements

The therapist agent requires careful consideration of several factors:

1. **Ethical Guidelines**:
   - Clear disclaimers about AI limitations
   - Appropriate crisis handling
   - Privacy protection
   - Professional boundary maintenance

2. **Therapeutic Boundaries**:
   - No medical diagnosis
   - No prescription of medication
   - Clear distinction from professional therapy
   - Appropriate referral to professionals

3. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Secure data storage
   - Privacy protection
   - Session management
   - Context maintenance

## Example Interactions

**Interaction 1**: Initial Session

```
> I've been feeling anxious about my upcoming presentation

I understand that presentations can be anxiety-provoking. I notice you've mentioned this before, and we discussed some breathing exercises. Would you like to try those again? Remember, it's completely normal to feel anxious in these situations. If your anxiety becomes overwhelming, please consider speaking with a mental health professional.
```

**Interaction 2**: Progress Check

```
> I tried the breathing exercise you suggested

I'm glad to hear you tried the breathing exercise. How did it work for you? Remember, these techniques often become more effective with practice. Would you like to explore other coping strategies as well?
```

**Interaction 3**: Pattern Recognition

```
> I'm feeling overwhelmed at work again

I notice this is a recurring theme in our conversations. We've discussed several strategies before, including mindfulness meditation and outdoor activities. Would you like to revisit any of these, or shall we explore new approaches? Remember, if these feelings persist, it might be helpful to speak with a professional therapist.
```

## Extending the Example

Here are some ways to extend this therapist agent:

1. **Crisis Detection**: Implement more sophisticated crisis detection and handling
2. **Progress Metrics**: Add quantitative progress tracking
3. **Therapeutic Techniques**: Expand the range of therapeutic approaches
4. **Multi-Modal Support**: Add support for different communication methods
5. **Professional Integration**: Create pathways for professional therapist involvement
6. **Resource Library**: Build a library of therapeutic resources and exercises

## Important Disclaimer

This AI therapist assistant is a demonstration of AI capabilities and should not be used as a replacement for professional therapy. Always seek professional help for serious mental health concerns. The agent is designed to provide supportive responses while maintaining appropriate boundaries and encouraging professional care when needed.
